Added the login jframe that john created and other features but I also deleted a few things (NOT FINISHED YET). Connected the project to the server Lehr provided. Created three tables called battleship_entity_player, battleship_entity_login, and battleship_xref_player_login. battleship_entity_player contains first name, last name, and email. battleship_entity_login contains username and password. I have not made a query with it yet because I'm not sure how.
